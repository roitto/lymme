# lymme
Simple web application which allows you to create lists collaboratively. Still an test version, but it works! It looks better on mobile.

* Remember to change the session secret key
* Remember to create right tables to the mysql.
* Change the mysql connection user/password to right one.


Icons are fontAwesome.
Thanks to realfavicongenerator.net also.

Todo:
- Update dependencies
- start using gulp or webpack
- make login system work better
- make desktop version better (it doesn't have all the tools the mobile does)
- change the li/item moving and ordering thing better (it uses this https://github.com/RubaXa/Sortable and i have to make better one)
- fix all the bugs. (:D)
